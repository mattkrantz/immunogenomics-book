Weekly Planning meeting 30 minutes. If wait you wait until Monday, you won't start your week with momentum. 3 hours/deep work per day.\n\n1 - Reflect on the prior week and how you did\n\n2 - Set up skeleton for week (5 min)\n\n-   Write/Design/Analysis in Mornings\n\n-   Meetings in Afternoon\n\n3 - Brain dump of things to get done; Map steps (15 min)\n\n4 - Tasks meet time (10 min)\n\nYou should keep and update your semester plan. Here is a link to an NCFDD example.\n\n::: callout-important\nWe drastically underestimate how long research and writing tasks will take. Multiplying your initial estimate by 1.5x - 2.5x might get you closer to realistically how long a particular task will take.\n:::\n\n### Task Tracking\n\nDon't need to track every last minute/hour. Just track the \"deep work\" hours. Cal Newport, Deep Work.\n\nHarvest Time app. Link to website.\n\nFreedom - block email during \"deep work\" time.\n\n### Mentor Meetings\n\nCould also be a peer.\n\nHave an agenda and take notes for the meeting.\n\n## Daily Writing Practice\n\nWhy is it that the most important academic activity for tenure, promotion, and professional reputation—writing—has the least amount of built-in accountability?\n\nIf you are a physician-scientist, you are a writer; therefore, you should write everyday (Monday - Friday).\n\n+:------------:+:-----------------------------------------------------------------:+:-------------------:+\n| *Less*       | **Built-in accountability**                                       | *More*              |\n+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+\n| -   Writing  | **-\\>**                                                           | -   Service         |\n|              |                                                                   |                     |\n| -   Articles | **Activity**                                                      | -   Teaching        |\n|              |                                                                   |                     |\n| -   Grants   | **\\<-**                                                           | -   Clinic/Consults |\n+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+\n| *More*       | **Importance for tenure, promotion, and professional reputation** | *Less*              |\n+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+\n\n: Built-in accountability and importance for tenure, promotion, and professional reputation by activity {#tbl-accountability-importance}\n\n::: callout-note\nThe most important part of your promotion—writing—has the least accountability.\n:::\n\n|                     Belief                     |                                                                 Reality                                                                 |\n|:----------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|         \"I need huge blocks of time.\"          |                            \"*Both unrealistic and untrue.* You can productively write in 30 minute blocks!\"                             |\n|         \"I must be inspired to write.\"         | \"*No, you don't.* If you put it on your calendar, you can show up to write just like you show up to meetings you don't want to attend.\" |\n| \"Writing is what I do when I'm done thinking.\" |                                                        \"*Writing is thinking.*\"                                                         |\n\n: Limiting beliefs to cultivating a daily writing practice.

So, if you write 30 minutes Monday to Friday, you are already at 2.5 hours!\n\n### Tips for Daily Writing\n\nSchedule your writing in your calendar like any other meeting or clinical duty.\n\nYou should write first thing in the morning. Knock out the most important daily task for your career first!\n\nMap complex goals to attainable steps.\n\nUse a timer, stop when the timer goes off (to avoid slipping back into writing in huge chunks).\n\nLeave yourself a \"breadcrumb,\" so you can pick up where you left off.\n\nGive yourself a treat after writing.\n\nDo a reflection at the end of the week (Friday) on how your writing went.\n\n### Benefits of Daily Writing\n\nWriting daily helps align your time with your evaluation criteria (e.g. 80% research and 20% clinical).\n\n| Benefit            | Description                                                                                        |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Productivity Shift | Leads to slow, steady productivity and fewer feelings of anxiety over meeting writing expectations |\n| Mental Shift       | Writing is the most important part of your success; therefore, it is your top priority.            |\n| Behavior Shift     | You write everyday and find a way to be accountable that works for you!                            |\n\n: Benefits of daily writing.

The annual [AAMC Faculty Salary Report](https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/workforce/report/aamc-faculty-salary-report) compiles academic faculty salaries by rank, degree, department/specialty, medical school type, region, and more. This is often available for free through your university library. Get to know your librarian!\n\n### Tenure-Track Offer Letters\n\nWhat goes into a tenure-track offer letter?
