## Building Accountability

### Semester Plan by Week

Every Friday, you should schedule yourself 30 minutes to plan your next week. Weekly Planning meeting 30 minutes. If wait you wait until Monday, you won't start your week with momentum. 3 hours/deep work per day.

1 - Reflect on the prior week and how you did

2 - Set up skeleton for week (5 min)

-   Write/Design/Analysis in Mornings

-   Meetings in Afternoon

3 - Brain dump of things to get done; Map steps (15 min)

4 - Tasks meet time (10 min)

You should keep and update your semester plan. Here is a link to an NCFDD example.

We drastically underestimate how long research and writing tasks will take. Multiplying your initial estimate by 1.5x - 2.5x might get you closer to realistically how long a particular task will take.

### Task Tracking

Don't need to track every last minute/hour. Just track the "deep work" hours. Cal Newport, Deep Work.

Harvest Time app. Link to website.

Freedom - block email during "deep work" time.

### Mentor Meetings

Could also be a peer.

Have an agenda and take notes for the meeting.

## Daily Writing Practice

Why is it that the most important academic activity for tenure, promotion, and professional reputation—writing—has the least amount of built-in accountability?

If you are a physician-scientist, you are a writer; therefore, you should write everyday (Monday - Friday).

### Time Target for Daily Writing

Your goal should be to spend 3 or more hours per week on scholarly writing. So, if you write 30 minutes Monday to Friday, you are already at 2.5 hours!

### Tips for Daily Writing

Schedule your writing in your calendar like any other meeting or clinical duty.

You should write first thing in the morning. Knock out the most important daily task for your career first!

Map complex goals to attainable steps.

Use a timer, stop when the timer goes off (to avoid slipping back into writing in huge chunks).

Leave yourself a "breadcrumb," so you can pick up where you left off.

Give yourself a treat after writing.

Do a reflection at the end of the week (Friday) on how your writing went.

### Benefits of Daily Writing

Writing daily helps align your time with your evaluation criteria (e.g. 80% research and 20% clinical).

+====================+====================================================================================================+
| Productivity Shift | Leads to slow, steady productivity and fewer feelings of anxiety over meeting writing expectations |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mental Shift       | Writing is the most important part of your success; therefore, it is your top priority.            |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Behavior Shift     | You write everyday and find a way to be accountable that works for you!                            |
