    "text": "1.5 Functional Divergence\nHeterozygosity of HLA class I genes is associated with better outcomes after HIV infection. This is thought to be due to a greater repertoire of HIV peptides presented and cytotoxic T cell response. However, looking at HLA class I allotype alone does not take into account differences in actual peptide repertoire. Viard and O’hUigin developed a metric to measure this difference, termed “functional divergence.” Functional divergence predicts the peptide repertoire as a continuum. They showed that greater functional divergence was associated with better HIV outcomes. Functional divergence may be relevant to other diseases where HLA heterozygosity confers advantage, such as infection, vaccination, and immunotherapy.\nYou can download functional divergence estimates for pairwise combinations of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles from their article’s Supplementary Materials. The functional divergence measure ranges from 0 (i.e., smallest functional divergence) to 1 (i.e., greatest functional divergence)."

    "text": "KIR is located on chromosome 19 (19q13.4) in the Leukocyte Receptor Complex (LRC). KIR is expressed on the surface of Natural Killer (NK) cells and some T cells. KIR do not undergo somatic rearrangement–a key difference from T-cell receptors. KIR interacts with HLA class I–their cognate ligand–to recognize and destroy unhealthy tissue cells while preventing the same from occurring to healthy cells. Therefore, NK cells play a role in fighting infections, resisting some cancers, pregnancy, and preventing autoimmunity. For further reading and references, I highly recommend the review article by Pollock, Harrison, and Norman on the immunogenetics and co-evolution of KIR and HLA class I."

    "text": "8.5 Figures\nI recommend creating your figures as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The main advantages of the SVG format include always maintaining its resolution and smaller file size than pixel-based image formats (e.g., JPEG).\nSome tools that you can use to get started creating SVG include Microsoft PowerPoint (subscription), Adobe Illustrator (subscription), draw.io (free), and Inkscape (free). Draw.io is best for diagrams and flowcharts. Inkscape is better for flexible drawings. Both draw.io and Inkscape are integrated with Bioicons, an open-source extension which includes >1700 icons for scientific illustrations.\nIn Microsoft PowerPoint, you can create an SVG file by selecting all shapes, right-clicking, choosing “Save as Picture”, and then picking “SVG” as the “Save as Type.”"

While a good host for a presentation should have a hub (or dongle if that’s your preferred terminology), you can come prepared with your own too–particularly important if you have a laptop with only USB-C ports and no HDMI port.\nThere are lots of options for hubs. If you are looking for a recommendation, I’ve found that Anker usually has a selection of high-quality and affordable hubs.\n\n\n8.7.3 USB Drive\nDo you want the entire audience to see your most recent emails when you login to download the PowerPoint you emailed yourself? No. Me either. To avoid this, bring your presentation loaded onto a USB drive, which should ideally have both USB-A and USB-C ports. Or, you can also avoid this by using your own laptop—where the presentation should already be downloaded.\n\n\n8.7.4 Presentation Remote\nI don’t feel as strongly about bringing your own presentation remote as your own laptop, hub, and USB drive–but I think it is another piece of equipment to consider. This helps keep you from being tethered to and white knuckling the podium during your talk.\nOne option to consider is the Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote–which includes features such as magnification, vibration alerts for time management (e.g., 5 minutes left), 3 hours use from 1 minute of charging, and connection by USB receiver or Bluetooth–in addition to slide advancement."
