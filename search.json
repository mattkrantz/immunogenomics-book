    "text": "Functional Divergence\nHeterozygosity of HLA class I genes is associated with better outcomes after HIV infection. This is thought to be due to a greater repertoire of HIV peptides presented and cytotoxic T cell response. However, looking at HLA class I allotype alone does not take into account differences in actual peptide repertoire. Viard et al. (2024) developed a metric to measure this difference, termed “functional divergence.” Functional divergence predicts the peptide repertoire as a continuum. They showed that greater functional divergence was associated with better HIV outcomes. Functional divergence may be relevant to other diseases where HLA heterozygosity confers advantage, such as infection, vaccination, and immunotherapy.\nYou can download functional divergence estimates for pairwise combinations of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles from their article’s Supplementary Materials. The functional divergence measure ranges from 0 (i.e., smallest functional divergence) to 1 (i.e., greatest functional divergence)."

KIR interacts with HLA class I–their cognate ligand–to recognize and destroy unhealthy tissue cells while preventing the same from occurring to healthy cells. Therefore, NK cells play a role in fighting infections, resisting some cancers, pregnancy, and preventing autoimmunity.

Eyrthromycin and clarithromycin have 14 carbons in their lactone rings while azithromycin has 15.\nWhat is the mechanism of action of macrolides?\nAs 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors, macrolides exert their bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting protein synthesis.\nWhat is the cross-reactivity pattern macrolide antibiotics?\nWhile not extensively studied, macrolide antibiotics with a different number of carbon atoms in their lactone ring are tolerated by most patients. Macrolide antibiotics are also unlikely to cross-react with macrolide immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus).\nWhat are some infections that use macrolides as first-line therapy?\nClarithyromycin is used as part of combination treatment for H. pylori. Azithromycin is a part of the first-line combination therapy for Mycobacterium avium complex.\n\n\nNon-Hypersensitivity Reactions\nGI Side Effects\nBecause macrolides are also agonists for the motilin receptor–stimulating gastric and small intestine motility–they can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdmoninal cramping. Accordingly, erythromycin can be used as a treatment for gastroparesis.\nSensorineural Otoxicity\nMacrolides can cause usually, transient sensorineural ototoxicity.\nQT Interval Prolongation\nMacrolides are associated with QT interval prolongation.\n\n\nSkin Testing\nSkin testing for macrolide immediate hypersensitivity has not been shown to be reliable.\n\n\nOral Challenge\nFor patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, graded azithromycin challenge can be performed, starting with azithromycin 25 mg followed by 1 hour observation then 250 mg followed by 2 hour observation.\nFor patients with a history of non-severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, single dose azithromycin 250 mg challenge with 2 hour observation can be performed. Patients should be instructed to report any other delayed symptoms, which may occur up to 24 to 48 hours after the challenge dose.\n\n\n\nPenicillins\n\n\nSulfa Antibiotics\n\n\nVancomycin\n\n\n\nBuproprion\n\n\nIron\n\nBackground\nWhy is intravenous (IV) iron used?\nIV iron is used for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia when oral iron is effective or not tolerated.\nWhat IV iron formulations are available in the United States?\nFormulations available in the United States include low-molecular-weight iron dextran (LWMID), ferric gluconate, iron sucrose, ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside, and ferric carboxymaltose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHigh-molecular weight iron dextrans were discontinued in the United States due to having a higher rate of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: Characteristics of iron formulations available in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneric name\nIron gluconate\nIron Sucrose\nLMWID\nFerric carboxymaltose\nIron isomaltoside\nFerumoxytol\n\n\n\n\nBrand name\nFerrlecit\nVenofer\nINFeD\nInjectafer\nMonofer\nFeraHeme\n\n\nMolecular weight (kD)\n289-440\n30-60\n165\n150\n150\n750\n\n\nLabile iron (% injected dose)\n3.3\n3.5\n2\n0.6\n1\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediate Hypersensitivity Reactions\nWhat is the incidence of anaphylactic reactions with IV iron?\nAnaphylactic reactions—when high-molecular weight dextrans are excluded—occur with an incidence of < 1 in 200,000.\nSignificant differences in reaction risk have not been shown among low-molecular weight iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, and ferric carboxymaltose.\nWhat is mechanism of most IV iron immediate hypersensitivity reactions?\nMost IV iron immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated through complement-activation related pseudoallergy (CARPA). Rarely, hypersensitivity reactions are IgE-mediated.\n\n\nMinor Infusion Reactions\nWhat are the symptoms of minor infusion reactions to IV iron?\nSymptoms of minor infusion reactions to IV iron include—flushing, chest/back tightness, myalgias—and, importantly, do not have any features of anaphylaxis.\nWhat is considered to be the main driver of minor infusion reactions to IV iron?\nLabile, or also called “free,” iron is associated with minor infusion reactions to IV iron.\n\n\nSkin Testing\nWhat is the utility of immediate skin testing for IV iron hypersensitivity reactions?\nAs most hypersensitivity reactions are non-IgE-mediated—rather via CARPA—skin testing has limited utility for evaluating IV iron hypersensitivity reactions; however, it may help detect the rare patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.\n\n\nManagement\nWhat are some approaches to subsequent IV iron administration in patients with previous IV iron reactions?\nApproaches for patients with history of mild to moderate IV iron reactions include: switching to an alternative IV iron formulation, slowing the infusion rate (e.g., 10% of recommended rate during the first 10 to 15 minutes), and/or pre-treatment with non-sedating, second generation antihistamines.\nFor patients with a history of anaphylactic reactions to IV iron, desensitization can be considered, such as ferric gluconate.\n\n\nReferences\nGómez-Ramírez S, Shander A, Spahn DR, et al. Prevention and management of acute reactions to intravenous iron in surgical patients.

Expert Opin Drug Saf 2018; 17: 149-59.\n\n\n\nLocal Anesthetics\n\n\nRadiocontrast\n\nBackground\nHow do modern, radiocontrasts differ from older radiocontrasts?\nModern radiocontrasts are non-ionic, iodinated and either iso-osmolal or low-osmolality. Older radiocontrasts were high-osmolality–which are no longer used intravenously.\nIs radiocontrast allergy related to iodine or seafood allergy?\nThe radiocontrast molecular structure is responsible for hypersensitivity reactions–not iodine or seafood allergy. Shellfish allergy is secondary to tropomyosin not iodine.\n\n\nInfusion Reactions\nThese are also referred to as “toxic” or “chemotoxic” reactions. Characteristic symptoms include transient warmth/flushing, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, metallic taste, hypertension, and/or vasogal signs.\n\n\nImmediate Hypersensitivity Reactions\nThe most common immediate hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is mild urticaria and pruritus, occuring in ~0.9% - 3.1% of patients receiving radiocontrast. Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.02% - 0.04% of patients. Of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, 70% occur within 5 minutes of radiocontrast injection and 96% of severe reactions occur within 20 minutes.\n\n\nDelayed Hypersensitivity Reactions\nThe most common delayed hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is a maculopapular exanthem–occurring in 1 to 3% of patients.\n\n\nSkin Testing\nSkin prick testing to the culprit and other radiocontrasts followed by intradermal testing–if skin prick testing is negative–can be useful for identifying an alternative radiocontrast agent. A skin test negative radiocontrast alternative has a 95% NPV.\n\n\nIntravenous Challenge\nIntravenous challenge can be performed to radiocontrast with various protocols–such as 1 mL, 5 mL, 15, mL, and 50 mL (cumulative 71 mL) at 60 minute intervals.\n\n\nManagement\nThe culprit radiocontrast should be avoided, and an alternative radiocontrast should be used, guided by negative skin testing if available. Other measures to decrease risk of recurrent radiocontrast reaction include: lowering the radiocontrast dose, decreasing the injection speed, and pre-treatment with non-sedating, second generation antihistamines and/or corticosteroids."

    "text": "Genome Assemblies\nThe Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) is the main source of human genome assembly data. The most recent human genome assembly version is GRCh38, released in 2013. The “h” in “GRCh” stands for “human.” The GRC also maintains genome assembly data for rat (r), mouse (m), zebrafish (z), and chicken (g for gallus). Major updates, called “versions”, are released every few years. Minor updates are called “patches” and are released more frequently.\nGRCh38 is referred to as “hg38” in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. The “hg” stands for “human genome.” Before the GRCh38 genome assembly, the version numbers of the GRC and UCSC Genome Browser genome assemblies did not match. For example, when the GRCh37 genome assembly was released in 2009, the UCSC Genome Browser version was “hg19.” Therefore, to minimize confusion, starting with the GRCh38 genome assembly, the UCSC Genome Browser version number was matched as “hg38.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRC Version\nUCSC Version\nYear Released\nGenome\nCoverage\nAlternate Haplotypes\n\n\n\n\nGRCh37\nhg19\n2009\n~92.5%\n3 regions with 9 alternate loci\n\n\nGRCh38\nhg38\n2013\n95%\n178 regions with 261 alternate loci"

Draw.io is best for diagrams and flowcharts. Inkscape is better for flexible drawings. Both draw.io and Inkscape are integrated with Bioicons, an open-source extension which includes >1700 icons for scientific illustrations.\nIn Microsoft PowerPoint, you can create an SVG file by selecting all shapes, right-clicking, choosing “Save as Picture”, and then picking “SVG” as the “Save as Type.”"

While a good host for a presentation should have a hub (or dongle if that’s your preferred terminology), you can come prepared with your own too–particularly important if you have a laptop with only USB-C ports and no HDMI port.\nThere are lots of options for hubs. If you are looking for a recommendation, I’ve found that Anker usually has a selection of high-quality and affordable hubs.\n\n\nUSB Drive\nDo you want the entire audience to see your most recent emails when you login to download the PowerPoint you emailed yourself? No. Me either. To avoid this, bring your presentation loaded onto a USB drive, which should ideally have both USB-A and USB-C ports. Or, you can also avoid this by using your own laptop—where the presentation should already be downloaded.\n\n\nPresentation Remote\nI don’t feel as strongly about bringing your own presentation remote as your own laptop, hub, and USB drive–but I think it is another piece of equipment to consider. This helps keep you from being tethered to and white knuckling the podium during your talk.\nOne option to consider is the Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote–which includes features such as magnification, vibration alerts for time management (e.g., 5 minutes left), 3 hours use from 1 minute of charging, and connection by USB receiver or Bluetooth–in addition to slide advancement."
