This is thought to be due to a greater repertoire of HIV peptides presented and cytotoxic T cell response. However, looking at HLA class I allotype alone does not take into account differences in actual peptide repertoire. @viard_impact_2024 developed a metric to measure this difference, termed “functional divergence.” Functional divergence predicts the peptide repertoire as a continuum. They showed that greater functional divergence was associated with better HIV outcomes. Functional divergence may be relevant to other diseases where HLA heterozygosity confers advantage, such as infection, vaccination, and immunotherapy.\nYou can download functional divergence estimates for pairwise combinations of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles from their article’s Supplementary Materials. The functional divergence measure ranges from 0 (i.e., smallest functional divergence) to 1 (i.e., greatest functional divergence).",

KIR do not undergo somatic rearrangement–a key difference from T-cell receptors. KIR interacts with HLA class I–their cognate ligand–to recognize and destroy unhealthy tissue cells while preventing the same from occurring to healthy cells. Therefore, NK cells play a role in fighting infections, resisting some cancers, pregnancy, and preventing autoimmunity. For further reading and references, I highly recommend the review article by Pollock, Harrison, and Norman on the immunogenetics and co-evolution of KIR and HLA class I.",

However, ACD can become generalized to non-exposed sites, referred to as “autoeczematization” or “id reaction.”\nThe differential diagnosis for ACD also includes irritant contact dermatitis as well as other chronic eczematous dermatoses (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis).\nThe top 4 drug category causes of ACD are: antibiotics, local anesthetics, corticosteroids, and propylene glycol (techically an excipient).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAntibiotics (e.g., neomycin, bacitracin, polymyxin B) are the most common cause of ACD.

Eyrthromycin and clarithromycin have 14 carbons in their lactone rings while azithromycin has 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the mechanism of action of macrolides?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitors, macrolides exert their bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting protein synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the cross-reactivity pattern macrolide antibiotics?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not extensively studied, macrolide antibiotics with a different number of carbon atoms in their lactone ring are tolerated by most patients. Macrolide antibiotics are also unlikely to cross-react with macrolide immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some infections that use macrolides as first-line therapy?\n\n\n\n\n\nClarithyromycin is used as part of combination treatment for H. pylori. Azithromycin is a part of the first-line combination therapy for Mycobacterium avium complex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat non-hypersensitivity reactions are associated with macrolides?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGI side effects: Because macrolides are also agonists for the motilin receptor–stimulating gastric and small intestine motility–they can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdmoninal cramping. Accordingly, erythromycin can be used as a treatment for gastroparesis.\nSensorineural ototoxicity (usually transient).\nQT interval prolongation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin Testing\nSkin testing for macrolide immediate hypersensitivity has not been shown to be reliable.\n\n\nOral Challenge\nFor patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, graded azithromycin challenge can be performed, starting with azithromycin 25 mg followed by 1 hour observation then 250 mg followed by 2 hour observation.\nFor patients with a history of non-severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a macrolide, single dose azithromycin 250 mg challenge with 2 hour observation can be performed. Patients should be instructed to report any other delayed symptoms, which may occur up to 24 to 48 hours after the challenge dose.\n\n\n\nPenicillins\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of the US population reports an allergy to penicillin?\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 10% of the US population reports an allergy to penicillin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf individuals reporting a penicillin allergy, what percent are clinically significant immediate or delayed immune-mediated drug reactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nLess than 5% of these reported penicillin allergies are clinically significant immediate or delayed-immune mediated drug reactions.\nOver 95% of patients who do not have a history of serious penicillin allergy are actually tolerant because (1) the most common reported reaction is a benign delayed rash (type IV hypersensitivity reaction) which may or may not recur with subsequent penicillin exposure; (2) IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade since their index reaction; and (3) the index reaction may have rather been an intolerance or caused by the underlying infection being treated at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat infections are individuals with a history of penicillin allergy at higher risk of developing due to receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics?\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who report a penicillin allergy label are more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection.\nReceipt of non-beta-lactam perioperative prophylaxis has been associated with an increased risk of surgical site infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat infection-related drug interaction is associated with individuals developing a maculopapular rash when receiving an aminopenicillin?\n\n\n\n\n\nEpstein-Barr virus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of penicillin administrations result in a reaction that could be consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, most often a rash, that could also be nonallergic?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 0.5% to 2.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing. What is a potential hypothesis for this trend?\n\n\n\n\n\nPotentially due to the decrease in use of parenteral penicillins in the outpatient setting, where most antibiotic use occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin Testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the NPV of penicillin skin testing?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NPV of penicillin skin testing is &gt; 95% when performed with only PPL plus penicillin G or with PPL plus full panel of minor derterminants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReagent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nPenicilloyl polylysine (PPL, PrePen®)\n\nMajor antigenic determinant (what 95% of penicillin degrades into); PPL is penicilloyl complexed with polyltysine to constitute a multivalent skin test reagent.

    "text": "Radiocontrast\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do modern radiocontrasts differ from older radiocontrasts?\n\n\n\n\n\nModern radiocontrasts are non-ionic, iodinated and either iso-osmolal or low-osmolality. Older radiocontrasts were high-osmolality–which are no longer used intravenously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs radiocontrast allergy related to iodine or seafood allergy?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe radiocontrast molecular structure is responsible for hypersensitivity reactions–not iodine or seafood allergy. Shellfish allergy is secondary to tropomyosin not iodine.\n\n\n\n\n\nInfusion Reactions\nThese are also referred to as “toxic” or “chemotoxic” reactions. Characteristic symptoms include transient warmth/flushing, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, metallic taste, hypertension, and/or vasogal signs.\n\n\nImmediate Hypersensitivity Reactions\nThe most common immediate hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is mild urticaria and pruritus, occuring in ~0.9% - 3.1% of patients receiving radiocontrast. Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.02% - 0.04% of patients. Of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, 70% occur within 5 minutes of radiocontrast injection and 96% of severe reactions occur within 20 minutes.\n\n\nDelayed Hypersensitivity Reactions\nThe most common delayed hypersensitivity reaction to radiocontrast is a maculopapular exanthem–occurring in 1 to 3% of patients.\n\n\nSkin Testing\nSkin prick testing to the culprit and other radiocontrasts followed by intradermal testing–if skin prick testing is negative–can be useful for identifying an alternative radiocontrast agent. A skin test negative radiocontrast alternative has a 95% NPV.\n\n\nIntravenous Challenge\nIntravenous challenge can be performed to radiocontrast with various protocols–such as 1 mL, 5 mL, 15, mL, and 50 mL (cumulative 71 mL) at 60 minute intervals.\n\n\nManagement\nThe culprit radiocontrast should be avoided, and an alternative radiocontrast should be used, guided by negative skin testing if available. Other measures to decrease risk of recurrent radiocontrast reaction include: lowering the radiocontrast dose, decreasing the injection speed, and pre-treatment with non-sedating, second generation antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.",

Major updates, called “versions”, are released every few years. Minor updates are called “patches” and are released more frequently.\nGRCh38 is referred to as “hg38” in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. The “hg” stands for “human genome.” Before the GRCh38 genome assembly, the version numbers of the GRC and UCSC Genome Browser genome assemblies did not match. For example, when the GRCh37 genome assembly was released in 2009, the UCSC Genome Browser version was “hg19.” Therefore, to minimize confusion, starting with the GRCh38 genome assembly, the UCSC Genome Browser version number was matched as “hg38.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRC Version\nUCSC Version\nYear Released\nGenome\nCoverage\nAlternate Haplotypes\n\n\n\n\nGRCh37\nhg19\n2009\n~92.5%\n3 regions with 9 alternate loci\n\n\nGRCh38\nhg38\n2013\n95%\n178 regions with 261 alternate loci",

Draw.io is best for diagrams and flowcharts. Inkscape is better for flexible drawings. Both draw.io and Inkscape are integrated with Bioicons, an open-source extension which includes &gt;1700 icons for scientific illustrations.\nIn Microsoft PowerPoint, you can create an SVG file by selecting all shapes, right-clicking, choosing “Save as Picture”, and then picking “SVG” as the “Save as Type.”",

While a good host for a presentation should have a hub (or dongle if that’s your preferred terminology), you can come prepared with your own too–particularly important if you have a laptop with only USB-C ports and no HDMI port.\nThere are lots of options for hubs. If you are looking for a recommendation, I’ve found that Anker usually has a selection of high-quality and affordable hubs.\n\n\nUSB Drive\nDo you want the entire audience to see your most recent emails when you login to download the PowerPoint you emailed yourself? No. Me either. To avoid this, bring your presentation loaded onto a USB drive, which should ideally have both USB-A and USB-C ports. Or, you can also avoid this by using your own laptop—where the presentation should already be downloaded.\n\n\nPresentation Remote\nI don’t feel as strongly about bringing your own presentation remote as your own laptop, hub, and USB drive–but I think it is another piece of equipment to consider. This helps keep you from being tethered to and white knuckling the podium during your talk.\nOne option to consider is the Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote–which includes features such as magnification, vibration alerts for time management (e.g., 5 minutes left), 3 hours use from 1 minute of charging, and connection by USB receiver or Bluetooth–in addition to slide advancement.",
