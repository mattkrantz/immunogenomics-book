    "text": "1.5 Functional Divergence\nHeterozygosity of HLA class I genes is associated with better outcomes after HIV infection. This is thought to be due to a greater repertoire of HIV peptides presented and cytotoxic T cell response. However, looking at HLA class I allotype alone does not take into account differences in actual peptide repertoire. Viard and O’hUigin developed a metric to measure this difference, termed “functional divergence.” Functional divergence predicts the peptide repertoire as a continuum. They showed that greater functional divergence was associated with better HIV outcomes. Functional divergence may be relevant to other diseases where HLA heterozygosity confers advantage, such as infection, vaccination, and immunotherapy.\nYou can download functional divergence estimates for pairwise combinations of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles from their article’s Supplementary Materials. The functional divergence measure ranges from 0 (i.e., smallest functional divergence) to 1 (i.e., greatest functional divergence)."

KIR do not undergo somatic rearrangement–a key difference from T-cell receptors. KIR interacts with HLA class I–their cognate ligand–to recognize and destroy unhealthy tissue cells while preventing the same from occurring to healthy cells. Therefore, NK cells play a role in fighting infections, resisting some cancers, pregnancy, and preventing autoimmunity. For further reading and references, I highly recommend the review article by Pollock, Harrison, and Norman on the immunogenetics and co-evolution of KIR and HLA class I."
