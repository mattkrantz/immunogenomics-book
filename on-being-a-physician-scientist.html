<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tips-for-daily-writing">Tips for Daily Writing</h3>
<p>Schedule your writing in your calendar like any other meeting or clinical duty.</p>
<p>You should write first thing in the morning. Knock out the most important daily task for your career first!</p>
<p>Map complex goals to attainable steps.</p>
<p>Use a timer, stop when the timer goes off (to avoid slipping back into writing in huge chunks).</p>
<p>Leave yourself a “breadcrumb,” so you can pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>Give yourself a treat after writing.</p>
<p>Do a reflection at the end of the week (Friday) on how your writing went.</p>
