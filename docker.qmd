# Containerization with Docker

-   Docker = sets up a virtual computer (e.g. install software)

    -   Then saves the resulting state of the virtual computer = "image"

    -   Container = running instance of an image

    -   An image can be transferred and executed on any machine that has Docker installed

    -   Containers = lightweight

        -   Start rapidly

        -   Run with little overhead

        -   Do no need much storage space

::: callout-note
Containers achieve this by reusing large parts of the host operating system.

::: callout-important
Software versions should be precisely documented to ensure full computational reproducibility.
